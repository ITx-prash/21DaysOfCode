## üìÖ **Day-by-Day Progress**

| Day | Topic                             | Summary                                                                                                                                                     | Link                        |
| --- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 01  | JavaScript History & Execution    | Learned about the history of JavaScript and how the code execution works.                                                                                   | [Day 1 Insights](./Day-01/) |
| 02  | Execution Context in JavaScript   | Explored the environment where JavaScript code runs, including global and function execution contexts, the call stack, and JIT compilation.                 | [Day 2 Insights](./Day-02/) |
| 03  | JavaScript Data Types & Loops     | Explored JavaScript data types, loops, and objects, and revised key topics.                                                                                 | [Day 3 Insights](./Day-03/) |
| 04  | Arrays, Array Methods & Iteration | Learned about arrays, array methods, and how to iterate through array elements effectively.                                                                 | [Day 4 Insights](./Day-04/) |
| 05  | Iterating Objects & Arrays        | Explored `for...in` for iterating through objects, `for...of` and `.forEach()` for arrays, and arrow functions. Solved various problems involving object and array looping. | [Day 5 Insights](./Day-05/) |
| 06  | Lexical Scoping, Closures & Array Methods | Delved into lexical scoping and closures, explored higher-order functions like `.forEach()`, and worked with `filter()`, `Set`, `flat()`, and `reverse()` methods with examples and problems. | [Day 6 Insights](./Day-06/) |
