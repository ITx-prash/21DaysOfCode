## üöÄ **Why This Challenge?**

- To strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals.
- To explore its evolution and execution process.
- To practice coding daily and build consistency.
- To showcase my learning journey and contribute to open-source.
## üìÖ **Day-by-Day Progress**

| --- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 01  | JavaScript History & Execution    | Learned about the history of JavaScript and how the code execution works.                                                                                   | [Day 1 Insights](./Day-01/) |
| 02  | Execution Context in JavaScript   | Explored the environment where JavaScript code runs, including global and function execution contexts, the call stack, and JIT compilation.                 | [Day 2 Insights](./Day-02/) |
| 03  | JavaScript Data Types & Loops     | Explored JavaScript data types, loops, and objects, and revised key topics.                                                                                 | [Day 3 Insights](./Day-03/) |
| 04  | Arrays, Array Methods & Iteration | Learned about arrays, array methods, and how to iterate through array elements effectively.                                                                 | [Day 4 Insights](./Day-04/) |
| 05  | Iterating Objects & Arrays        | Explored `for...in` for iterating through objects, `for...of` and `.forEach()` for arrays, and arrow functions. Solved various problems involving object and array looping. | [Day 5 Insights](./Day-05/) |
| 06  | Lexical Scoping, Closures & Array Methods | Delved into lexical scoping and closures, explored higher-order functions like `.forEach()`, and worked with `filter()`, `Set`, `flat()`, and `reverse()` methods with examples and problems. | [Day 6 Insights](./Day-06/) |
| 07  | Hoisting, Scopes & Advanced Array Methods | Learned about hoisting of variables and functions, differences between `var` and `let` scopes, and practiced array methods like `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()`. Solved related problems. | [Day 7 Insights](./Day-07/) |
| 08  | Prototype Chain & Objects         | Explored JavaScript's prototype chain, how objects inherit properties and methods, and why it's often said that "everything in JavaScript is an object."   | [Day 8 Insights](./Day-08/) |
| 09  | OOP in JavaScript                 | Explored Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript, focusing on inheritance, constructor functions, prototypes, and ES6 classes. Practiced creating objects and using class inheritance. | [Day 9 Insights](./Day-09/) |
| 10  | Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism & Static Methods | Learned about encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in OOP. Practiced with examples of private variables, method overriding, and static methods in JavaScript. | [Day 10 Insights](./Day-10/) |
| 11  | Getters, Setters & OOP Examples   | Practiced Object-Oriented Programming concepts like getters and setters, class inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism through small coding exercises. | [Day 11 Insights](./Day-11/) |
| 12  | DOM Manipulation                  | Solved practical DOM manipulation problems, including accessing and traversing elements, adding/removing elements, CSS class toggling etc.  | [Day 12 Insights](./Day-12/) |
| 13  | Asynchronous Behavior in JavaScript                  | Learned how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations, including concepts like callbacks, the callback queue, the event loop. Explored examples of synchronous and asynchronous behavior.  | [Day 12 Insights](./Day-13/) |
| 14  | Promises & Function Methods       | Explored promises to handle asynchronous operations, including `then`, `catch`, and chaining. Learned about `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods for context manipulation. | [Day 14 Insights](./Day-14/) |
