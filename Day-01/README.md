# **Day 1: JavaScript History & Execution**

In Day 1 of my 21 Days of Code challenge, I explored the evolution and execution process of JavaScript. I learned about how JavaScript started in the 90s with Netscape, its transformation through the ECMA standardization, and how it has evolved into a powerful language with runtimes like Node.js, Deno, and Bun.

I also delved into the execution process of JavaScript code: how itâ€™s parsed, tokenized, converted to bytecode, and compiled at runtime using Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation. This gives JavaScript the ability to optimize resource usage and execute efficiently.
