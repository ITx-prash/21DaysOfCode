/*
For_in loop:
The for-in loop is used to loop through an object's properties.
syntax:
for (variable in object) {
  statement
}
variable: A different property name is assigned to variable on each iteration.
object: The object whose enumerable properties are iterated.
statement: Code block containing the statements to be executed.
Here variable say (key) is the kind of variable which moves though each 
of the iteration of the loop and in first loop it acts as a key of the first 
property. Similarly, acts as second key in second loop and we can access the value of the respective key.
Accessing Keys and Values in an Object:
Iteration Over Keys:
The for-in loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object. For each iteration, the loop variable (key) is assigned the name of a property (key) in the object.
Accessing Values:
To access the value associated with a key, we use bracket notation. For example, worldCities[key] gives us the value associated with the current key.

//Example:
let person = {
  First: "Prashant",
  "Last name": "Adhikari",
  class: 5,
  level: "Novice",
};
let per = {};

for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key);

  console.log(person[key]); //1st iteration:Prashant is the value of key First
  per[key] = person[key]; //1st iteration:per[First]=Prashant
  console.log(per[key]); //1st iteration per[First]=Prashant:
}
console.log(per);

    return; //the function is executed once for each array element so if chai is found it will return and not execute the next line i.e. like continue
  }

//for-of and forEach loop are used to iterate through an array.
//for-in loop is used to iterate through an object.
//function inside forEach loop is executed once for each array element.
